Do you remember [Davieâ€™s Burgers](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css-box-model/projects/box-model-on?course_redirect=learn-css) from our Learn CSS course? Well, the restaurant business has been booming and it is now looking to place a catchy advertisement in the local subway station.

Help them dig into their `orders` table to see if there is anything interesting in there for a funny tagline!
