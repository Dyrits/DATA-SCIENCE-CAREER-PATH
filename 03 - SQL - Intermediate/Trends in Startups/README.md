### Description of the project by [CODE]CADEMY PRO
Howdy! It’s your first day as a [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/) reporter. Your first task is to write an article on the rising trends in the startup world.

To get you started with your research, your boss emailed you a **project.sqlite** file that contains a table called `startups`. It is a portfolio of some of the biggest names in the industry.

Write queries with aggregate functions to retrieve some interesting insights about these companies.

What are you waiting for? Let’s get started!
