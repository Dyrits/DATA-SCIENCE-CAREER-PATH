## Description (from [code]cademy / PRO)
Letâ€™s practice what we learned about joins by combining rows from different tables.

Suppose you are a data analyst at REBU, a ridesharing platform. For a project, you were given three tables:
- `trips` - trips information
- `riders` - users data
- `cars` - autonomous cars

Have fun!
